🎯 Project Overview – Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application

📌 Objective

The goal of this project is to build a simple, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows two players (X and O) to play turn by turn, checks for winning conditions, and declares a winner or draw.

🏗 Technologies Used

JavaScript → Handles the game logic (player turns, win/draw detection, restart functionality).

⚙ How It Works

1. Game Board Setup

The board is a 3x3 grid made with HTML <div> elements.

Each cell is clickable and represents a position for X or O.



2. Player Turns

The game starts with Player X.

On each click, the current player’s marker (X or O) is placed in the selected cell.

Turns alternate automatically between X and O.



3. Win / Draw Checking

JavaScript checks all possible winning combinations (rows, columns, diagonals).

If a player gets three in a row, they are declared the winner.

If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.



4. Restart Option

A Restart button clears the board and resets the game.
